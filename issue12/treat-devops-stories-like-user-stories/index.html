					<p>In <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/p2magazine/issue11/analysing-the-devops-silo/">“Analysing the DevOps Silo</a>” (P2 Magazine, April 2015), I made an assertion that the whole team can and should get involved in all types of work. This might mean we lose the pretty colour-coding of our favourite story-management tool, but in turn we gain a way to acknowledge all the work we are doing—whether traditional feature stories, defect fixes, tech tasks or DevOps tasks—as valuable to the business. To do this successfully you have to restructure your mindset about these “technical” stories right from the start and keep that mindset strong throughout the development lifecycle. We have found that following these five tried-and-true activities is a great start.</p><blockquote><p>“One of the most valuable techniques analysts use when fleshing out stories is to apply a persona representing who is benefiting.”</p></blockquote><p class="block-img"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/p2-magazine/4b3ad368d255afe82dd7adb4cde7e05950d2fec5_colourful-team.jpg" alt=""></p><h3>1. Setting the groundwork with personas</h3><p>Our first major shift, and one of the most valuable techniques analysts use when fleshing out stories, is to apply a persona representing who is benefiting. Personas can be extravagant creations that define a potential user’s name, skill set and hopes for the system. But often all you really need to get started is a basic person or role. This means that in the story narrative (and yes, our “technical” stories now have narratives), instead of writing:</p><p><em>As a CI pipeline<br>I want Meta-Runners<br>So that we follow the DRY principle</em></p><p>...we write:</p><p><em>As a developer<br>I want the ability to maintain build step configurations in only one location<br>So that the risk of configuration divergence is reduced</em></p><h3>2. Follow the INVEST principle</h3><p>Just shifting the story’s wording is helpful, but the application of INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimatable, Small, Testable) principles is the real value add. Anyone who uses these will tell you it is nearly impossible to perfectly embody them all at the same time. These difficulties lead to the conversations that in turn balance stories as much as possible. Here is how INVEST can be applied to the example story:</p><ul><li><strong>Independent:</strong> Other work (e.g., the creation of a new build step or environment) could be done in parallel with this story, and it does not require any additional stories to complete testing or delivery of value.</li><li><strong>Negotiable:</strong> Prior to playing, we can negotiate the technical implementation (e.g., by using the TeamCity Meta-Runner option or a scripting solution).</li><li><strong>Valuable:</strong> This is valuable to the business by decreasing both time to make changes, and risk in updating configurations. And this is valuable to the development team by reducing tech debt and improving the stability of the build.</li><li><strong>Estimatable:</strong> A clear definition of what is in and out of scope allows for easier estimates. This includes build steps, not a limitless refactoring.</li><li><strong>Small:</strong> This is similar to estimatable and its goal of well-defined expectations. In addition, we focus on the removal of associated, but unique, value items such as environment variables.</li><li><strong>Testable:</strong> The first acceptance criterion is already uncovered; only one configuration change should be enough.</li></ul><p>By producing stories that follow INVEST, you are in a position to estimate and prioritise them with the rest of the stories. This was our second major shift. It encourages several behaviours in the team that, in an organic and slow way, lower the DevOps silo wall by doing the following:</p><ul><li>Keeping the entire team’s eyes on the card </li><li>Solidifying the expectations before we get started on implementation </li><li>Cross-functional pairing on defining (and later developing/testing) stories <br></li></ul><h3>3. Story kickoffs</h3><p>A story kickoff is a technique used as a “hand-off” between analysts and developers between stages of the software delivery lifecycle. One common use case is that kickoffs give time for analysts to answer context questions for the developers before they get started. Our third process change goes beyond this basic definition to realize the true value of this ceremony.</p><p>In our kickoffs we added the discussion of testing strategies and risks to allow us to better plan for the development process. Sometimes this included the identification of checkpoints throughout development where testing could begin before the whole story was complete, shortening the feedback loop even more. In our story we identified missing test harnesses 1.

A quick walkthrough of changes made gives an opportunity to clarify naming or add additional test cases. Hosting a desk check also backs up the testing discussion in kickoffs, because a desk check requires the setup of data and other dependencies to allow for a thorough walkthrough. At the most basic level, this confirms that the testing phase can begin, but it often has larger impacts by uncovering unexpected branches or missed requirements.
