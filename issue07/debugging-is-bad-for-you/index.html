					<p>I’m mildly bothered by announcements like “we’ve made it easier to attach a debugger”. Why? To me, using the debugger is an admission that you don’t understand the code. Consider all the times you used the debugger. Was your code working as you expected? Methinks not.</p><p>I used to live in the debugger. It was a homely place and I, a studious pupil of F5 Driven Development (also known as Debug Driven Development). I was in the process of tidying up my blog and I found this article where I talked about how the combination of the comma-operator and default parameters conspired to undo me.</p><p>Take a look at this code:</p><pre>if (collection-&gt;getCatalogue()-&gt;isMatch((*objectItr)-&gt;m_element), true)<br>{<br>   // we have a match and our catalogue is not updated<br>}<br>if (collection-&gt;getCatalogue()-&gt;isMatch((*objectItr)-&gt;m_element, true))<br>{<br>   // we have a match and our catalogue is updated<br>}</pre><p>The first calls isMatch that has a default parameter to false (don’t update the catalogue) and that boolean you see there, we’ll that’s a part of the if-statement and not the isMatch call. That’s because C++ has: operator,(). This is the comma-operator that evaluates each expression but only returns the right hand most value. From memory, the if-statement is always true.</p><p>The second block is how the code should have been, but it is very hard to spot the difference. We shouldn’t have written it this way for that very reason; its crappy code. There is all sorts of badness going on: the Law of Demeter, default parameters in interfaces, the command-query principle and a very poorly named function. Also, from the looks of this code I had a collection with a catalogue inside of it. What!?</p><p>I used the debugger to get me out of this mess. I should have just written a test and established some expectations. It would not have been hard, but back when I wrote this I didn’t really know how to do unit testing.</p><p>I don’t do this any more: write in C++ or use the debugger, unless I have to. So, what do I do when I encounter code that doesn’t work as expected? I follow these steps:</p><p>I make a mental note that this code is too complicated and I’ll need to refactor it. If I can’t make head nor tail of it, and I’m writing it, what hope is there for whoever follows me?</p><p>I have tests these days. So I’ll ask myself: are these tests trying to do too much? Could I write a more discrete test for this?</p><p>I make sure that I’ve stubbed all my dependencies correctly. Do I have too many dependencies? Could I reduce my overall dependency count by combining some of them?</p><p>I try and write simpler expectations. Do we even have a result? Is it JSON? Does it have the element we care about? Does it have our expected value? It’s usually a case that I’ve missed some simpler tests, that would have failed had I had them.</p><p>If I’ve done all this then it’s time to break out the debugger. Find out what is going on. Then go back and write some tests for what I just learned. Using the debugger is like a technical spike. You get in, you learn and then you get out. Once you’re out you do things properly.</p><p class="centered">⁂</p><p>There was a time once when I would step over each line of my code in the debugger to make sure it was doing what I expected it to do. This was before I released it. It was like the paper desk check.</p><p>What a waste of time.</p>
